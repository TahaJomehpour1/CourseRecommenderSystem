This project has created a recommender system API using multi-Objective optimization with library pymoo to help students to make a better decision for choosing an online course. 
The API is developed using flask python framework.
 The API has a graphical user interface that the users can use to enter their objectives to learn a course. They will enter their objectives in graphical interface and the API will recommend five courses that best match with userâ€™s objectives. The API has used multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA2 with ElementwiseProblem class that is used to define the optimization problem.
 This project goes through the research and developing the system with different methods and ways.

In terminal go inside the project directory and run the appv5.py by the command 

command is : flask --app appv5 run

and click on the link on the terminal.

put the skill a string that want the system to look for for example python/programming/bussines/drama etc.

for rating and didfficulty level input a numerical value.

the Jupyter_Model_RecommenderSystem.ipynb file si for showing analysis of the model and can be run in jupyter notebook.

run all the cells one by one in jupyter notebook and make sure that you have pymoo installed in your system.

coursera.csv is just the dataset that we are using.
